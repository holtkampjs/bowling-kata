# We will not implement:

- We will not check for valid rolls.
- We will not check for correct number of rolls and frames.
- We will not provide scores for intermediate frames.

# Suggested Test Cases
(When scoring “X” indicates a strike, “/” indicates a spare, “-” indicates a miss)

X X X X X X X X X X X X (12 rolls: 12 strikes) = 10 frames * 30 points = 300
9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- (20 rolls: 10 pairs of 9 and miss) = 10 frames * 9 points = 90
5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/5 (21 rolls: 10 pairs of 5 and spare, with a final 5) = 10 frames * 15 points = 150
